Installation

Prerequisites:

1.XAMPP Server

QUICK INSTALLATION

[NOTE: Unpack the package to your USB stick or a partition of your choice.
There it must be on the highest level like E:\ or W:\. It will
build E:\xampp or W:\xampp or something like this. Please do not use the "setup_xampp.bat" for an USB stick installation!]

Step 1: Unpack the package into a directory of your choice. Please start the
"setup_xampp.bat" and beginning the installation. Note: XAMPP makes no entries in the windows registry and no settings for the system variables.

Step 2: If installation ends successfully, start the Apache 2 with
"apache_start".bat", MySQL with "mysql_start".bat". Stop the MySQL Server with "mysql_stop.bat". For shutdown the Apache HTTPD, only close the Apache Command (CMD). Or use the fine XAMPP Control Panel with double-click on "xampp-control.exe"!

Step 3: Start your browser and type http://127.0.0.1 or http://localhost in the location bar. You should see our pre-made
start page with certain examples and test screens.

Step 4: PHP (with mod_php, as *.php), Perl by default with *.cgi, SSI with *.shtml are all located in => C:\xampp\htdocs\.
Examples:
- C:\xampp\htdocs\test.php => http://localhost/test.php
- C:\xampp\htdocs\myhome\test.php => http://localhost/myhome/test.php

What Project is about:
Mother Goose Kenya is a community-based organisation that focuses on helping communities to improve the quality of child care services.
They find young girls through partnerships, social media, and referrals, train them to be nannies, and house-help then employ them with guaranteed minimum wage.

This project aims to develop a website for MotherGoose to allows their clients to easily view and choose the nannies they want based on desired qualities.
The system will replace the manual record keeping system used currently using MS Excel and provide a database management system that will improve the efficiency of fucntionc like:
data storage, data retrieval, data processing and data display.
